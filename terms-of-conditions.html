                           <p>Our Services may feature multiplayer activities like competitive or cooperative player-versus-player or player-versus-environment interactions. At times, we might observe your and other players’ communications and interactions, but our capacity to do so is constrained by technological and legal limitations. Therefore, it’s your responsibility to manage your interactions with other users of our Services.</p>
                           <p>To use our Services, your device must fulfill certain minimum hardware and software criteria. Some Games and Services are exclusive to specific hardware and software systems, such as consoles, computer operating on Microsoft Windows® 10 or mobile devices (Android, iOS…). Additionally, you might need a reliable internet connection with adequate upload and download speeds to use our Services. We will make every effort to inform you about the necessary requirements before you start using our Services, though these may vary. If your device does not meet the required criteria to access Games or other Services, we cannot be held liable for any issues that arise from their use or any damage they may cause to your device.</p>
                           <p>You might suffer from seizures when you’re exposed to specific light patterns or flashing lights during the use of our Services or related content (i.e. related ads). Being exposed to certain light patterns or backgrounds on a video screen or through virtual reality, augmented reality, or glasses/equipment could trigger an epileptic seizure, even in individuals without a history of seizures or epilepsy. WODT is not liable for these effects, and you are assuming the risk by accessing and using the Services and viewing the ads or any incrusted or related content. Additionally, WODT is not responsible for any motion sickness, balance issues, or other problems that might arise from using the Services, viewing the ads or any incrusted or related content.</p>
                           <p>When accessing any third party platform or device (i.e. marketplaces, publishers platforms, console environments), you are bounded to any terms those third parties will introduce their own terms, rules and conditions regarding the use of their services and ours. These rules and conditions will create a separate contract between you and the specific third party, in addition to the agreement on WODT terms. You must agree to those terms before you can use our Services.</p>
                           <p>You are also obligated to follow all the rules and conditions set by third-party platforms and any authors or publishers who distribute the Services to you. A violation of any such third-party platforms or publisher’s rules will also be considered a breach of these Terms. If the Services include links to, and connect with, other services and resources provided by third parties, we have no control over what is on those services or resources, and we make no guarantees or promises about their legitimacy, accuracy, or quality. Any external website you visit by clicking on a link from the Services is completely your responsibility. We acknowledge no liability for the content, actions, safety, or handling of your personal information on these external sites. When you click on a link from our website to another site or use the social media sharing options on our site, remember that those sites and networks might have their own rules about privacy. We won’t be held responsible for what happens on those sites. Before you share any personal info on any external sites, please review their privacy policies.</p>
                           <h2>6.User generated content</h2>
                           <p>Upon using or during the course of accessing the Services, you may share text, images, or links, which can be made available to WODT or any other end users (websites, forums, etc.) or any other material you create using our tools and capabilities integrated in our Services. This is called “User generated content”. Please notice that our Services might have their own additional legal guidelines outlining your rights and responsibilities regarding this User Generated Content.</p>
                           <p>You shall retain all of your rights of ownership and be recognized as the creator of any User Generated Content you produce under the laws of the applicable law of you country, but since using or accessing our services you inherently agree to grant WODT certain rights over it to enable us to share it through our Services. Therefore, when you upload your User Generated Content to any device or platform, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide usable, transferable and sub-licensable, royalty-free, not subject to expiration, unchangeable license to use, modify, reproduce, create new works from, distribute, share, communicate, and publicly display and/or perform your User Generated Content within the Services.</p>
                           <p>You should ensure that you possess all the necessary legal rights before utilizing User Generated Content and to verify its safety for use. WODT is unable to verify this on our own, nor can we check it for you, so we depend on your diligence.</p>
                           <p>Should you create User Generated Content using any graphics, audio, video, text, gameplay, features, characters, settings, or any other content from the KJP services, you are free to use and share it for your personal enjoyment. However, it’s strictly prohibited to use or distribute it for financial gain or any commercial purposes and/or incorporate it into third-party games or services, or into any third-party products of any kind without our prior written approval. You can request this approval from our contact form listed at the very beginning of these Terms. Please be aware that we have the authority to review each request and decide to accept or reject it at our discretion.</p>
                           <p>In any cases, the User generated Content should adapt to the prohibited behavior of the section 5 of these Terms, including but not limited to: advertising, promotions or commercial (spam, junk mail, chain letters, scams) and/or infringes the rights of third parties (copyrights, brands, patents, design rights, moral rights, rights of privacy, rights of publicity or another proprietary right).</p>
                           <h2>7.Payment</h2>
                           <p>In order to access specific Service features or versions, as well as access additional content like levels, items, and other products, or premium goods or Services, you might need to pay certain fees.</p>
                           <p>These fees apply to specific versions and premium services, as well as access to additional content, and are only available to users who make a payment. All charges related to the Services and purchasable content must be made to the platform or service provider from which you are purchasing and downloading the Services in case our Services are hosted in such platforms or publishers. WODT is not involved in, or responsible, for these transactions. You can find the current payment details and terms on the platform or service provider’s access pages, etc.</p>
                           <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Services in order to introduce other products and Services, whether they are free, require a one-time fee, or a recurring fee. We, and/or the platform or third party provider, can adjust the payment details at any time. If any fees are subject to taxes, you may be charged additional taxes, in addition to the fees according to the applicable law of your country. Some Services may be available as “free-to-play,” or “free-to-use” allowing you to access and use certain parts or versions without making any upfront payment. However, other versions or specific parts and features are considered “premium features,” which require a fee or the purchase of purchasable content to access certain levels, features, etc. In such cases, you agree to pay the full amount for the purchasable content you have ordered in. You are responsible for the platform or third party provider that has valid credit card information or method accepted for making the payment. Payments may be handled through third-party payment service providers.</p>
                           <h2>8.Virtual currency and virtual items</h2>
                           <p>Upon accessing and using the Services, you might be offered the possibility to access digital items and currencies that could be exchanged to buy digital items within the Services using these digital currencies (referred to as Virtual Goods). These Virtual Goods could be bought directly from the Services, or they might be given to you according to the game or service’s rules. Under these terms, Virtual Goods are considered to be part of the game or service you’re using.</p>
                           <p>Buying Virtual Goods doesn’t give you ownership of these goods. Instead, buying Virtual Goods means you’re getting a temporary and limited license from us to use these goods within the game or service you’re in. This license comes with the same limitations as the license you have for using the service mentioned in Section 3 of these Terms.</p>
                           <p>WODT is not involved in handling money transactions for buying Virtual Goods. All transactions for Virtual Goods are managed by other platforms, payment services, and other third parties not affiliated with us. To buy Virtual Goods, you agree to the terms and conditions set by these third parties, which might include a clause stating that all purchases are final and no refunds are available. If you have any concerns or issues regarding a financial transaction related to Virtual Goods, please reach out to the third party you made the purchase from.</p>
                           <p>It is strictly forbidden for you to trade Virtual Goods outside the games or services they were obtained from, to use them as bets or wagers with others, or to exchange them for real money, goods, services, or anything else not within the games or services.</p>
                           <p>If your account is suspended, limited, modified, or deleted, or in case WODT decides to stop offering the Services, you will lose all Virtual Goods you’ve earned or bought without a refund. Similarly, if we decide to stop offering a specific Service, you will lose all Virtual Goods you’ve earned or bought from that game or service. Additionally, we reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, modify, and/or remove Virtual Goods at any time, and remain not legally bound to reimburse you for any money you’ve spent on purchasing these Virtual Goods or to compensate you or anyone else for any resulting losses.</p>
                           <h2>9.User Accounts</h2>
                           <p>For using or accessing most of our Services, you might need to sign up, while for others, an account will be set up for you automatically upon your first visit (each account is called an “Account”), and, occasionally, with a third party (devices, platforms, etc.)</p>
                           <p>To set up an account, you might have to share your age and location and other required personal data such as a mailing address, a username, a password, and any other details that are necessary for your account to be created.</p>
                           <p>We will handle and keep all this information safe, following our <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. It’s mandatory to provide correct, up-to-date, and full details about yourself when creating an account. You’re the one who needs to keep your account username and password private.</p>
                           <p>You also agree not to sell, give away, or share your account, or the username and password of your account, and you promise to let us know right away if you think someone is using your account without permission. You accept full responsibility for the consequences of any misuse or breaches about your account information or any unauthorized or fraudulent use about it with no right to compensation.</p>
                           <p>We can refuse to create any account for any given reason, and we have the power to shut down any account that breaks this agreement of these Terms, following the rules for account termination below, and to remove any account information according to our <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                           <p>If you ever delete your account or it gets deleted in application of these Terms or any of our policies, you will lose access to any data previously associated with your account, as well as any Virtual Goods attached to it.</p>
                           <h2>10.Limitation of liability</h2>

                              <li>any loss or damage that isn’t our fault or due to our carelessness;</li>

                              <li>loss or damage that you couldn’t have predicted when you agreed to these Terms, like losing data, missing opportunities, service disruptions, device or computer failures, or financial losses;</li>
                              <li>any damage to any device you employ for our Games or other Services, or to any data on that device, unless the damage is directly because of our failure to use reasonable skill and care in providing the Games or other Services;</li>
                              <li>any loss or damage that you experience because of the actions or omissions of others, like platforms, publishers, or other Service users;</li>
                              <li>any indirect, consequential, punitive, or unique loss or damage;</li>
                              <li>any loss or damage if we don’t provide the Services to you, if they are interrupted or suspended, or if we fail to follow the Terms because of events that are beyond our control, including but not limited to, natural disasters like storms, fires, floods, internet outages, epidemics, or pandemics, strikes, or riots.</li>
                           </ol>
                           <p>The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in the jurisdiction of the country where the user is located.</p>
                           <p>You understand and consent to engage in the Services at your own risk. You are aware of the potential dangers and risks involved in using our Services and the content related to them, which could include, but are not limited to, harm or damage to your own or others’ personal or real property, and/or injuries to users and others: physical or mental harm, pain, suffering, illness, temporary or permanent disability (including paralysis), financial or emotional distress, and even death. You recognize that these injuries or consequences could occur from playing the game, including, but not limited to, due to your own or others’ carelessness, violation of the rules, and/or other factors. You acknowledge and agree that you are fully aware of the risks, dangers, and hazards present in (or related to) the game and its accessories, such as headsets or other gear, and you willingly accept and take full responsibility for all these risks, dangers, hazards, and liabilities, whether they are caused by your own actions, others’, or unknown to you, including, without limitation, the risk of personal injury, death, property damage, or loss that may result from it.</p>
                           <p>You can only use the Services for personal, non-business reasons under these Conditions. However, if you use the Services for business activities in violation of these Conditions, we won’t be responsible for any financial losses, business setbacks, missed savings, damage to reputation, or loss of goodwill. If the local consumer protection laws in the country or state where you live don’t allow the liability limits mentioned in Paragraphs above, then those liability limits will only apply up to the point where the law of that area allows. These Terms won’t change any legal rights you might have as a user of the Services. We won’t be held responsible for any deaths or injuries caused by our carelessness or the deceit of our staff or other agents, or for any other situations that would be illegal to hold us liable for under the law.</p>
                           <p>WODT has taken all the required steps, within its capabilities and the latest technology, to ensure the Services and its content related work properly, and when needed, to reduce errors in the system, both in terms of technical issues and the content shared by Breach Studios on social media. We are not responsible for the legality, dependability, or usefulness of content from other sources on the Services, website or the social media profiles linked to them. If a user discovers any content that might be illegal, unlawful, or infringe on the rights of others, they should contact Breach Studios right away, using the email address <a href="mailto:info@worldofdigitaltechnology.com">info@worldofdigitaltechnology.com</a>, so we can take the necessary actions.</p>
                           <p>In any case these Terms won’t create any relationship of partnership, agency or employment between WODT and the user.</p>
                           <h2>11.Terms modifications</h2>
                           <p>As part of our efforts to enhance our Services, it could lead to these Terms being updated or modified. WODT has the authority to alter these Terms at any moment, whether you are aware of it or not, by updating the Terms on our websites. Using the Services after these updates will be considered as your agreement to the changes. These changes will only take effect for any issues or events that happen after the date of the update. You cannot change these Terms without our explicit permission. It’s your duty to regularly review these Terms to see if there have been any changes. If you disagree with any changes to these Services, you must stop using them immediately.</p>
                           <h2>12.Law and jurisdiction</h2>
                           <p>These terms are bound by your statutory and common law as a consumer and will not restrict any entitlements you may have, including unfair competition and tort, which cannot be removed by law, nor will they limit WODT responsibility for any deaths or injuries caused by its carelessness, nor any deceitful statements.</p>
                           <p>WODT is based in Spain. We had made our best efforts to ensure it meets the standards and laws of other countries. For any inquiry or doubt about this contact us using our contact form.</p>
                           <p>Using our Services and agreeing to these terms and conditions are subject to the laws of Spain, which will be the sole authority for interpreting, applying, and determining the rights, exclusions, permissions, and conditions of use, and will be interpreted in line with Spanish law and the parties agree to be bound by the Spanish courts’ jurisdiction, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
                           <p>Should any disagreement, conflict, or allegation arise concerning these Terms, or the Services you and WODT will initially strive to reach a casual agreement to resolve any dispute for a minimum of 30 days before taking any legal action. This casual negotiation phase will start after receiving a written notification from one of the involved parties. Any disagreements that stem from or pertain to these Terms, our Services and their advertising, or the interaction between you and us should be resolved through mandatory arbitration. This encompasses any claims that were incurred prior to your agreement with us. The sole disagreements not addressed by this clause are those related to the violation, safeguarding, or legitimacy of your, our, or our licensors’ trade secrets or copyrights, trademarks, or patents; or matters filed in small claims court. Any arbitration act will be held in Spain.</p>
                           <p>Every aspect of these Terms functions independently. Should any court or other authorized authority determine that any aspect is illegal or unenforceable, the rest of the terms and conditions will continue to be valid and binding.</p>
                           <p>If we choose not to take action against you, or if we wait to do so, it doesn’t imply that we’ve given up our rights against you, and it doesn’t indicate that you’re free from your responsibilities under this Agreement. Should we decide to forgive a violation by you, we’ll do so in writing, and that doesn’t imply that we’ll forgive any subsequent violations by you.</p>
